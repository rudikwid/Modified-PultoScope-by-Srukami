# Modified-PultoScope-by-Srukami
This is my successful version for PultoScope designed by Srukami. Since my 2.4" TFT display shield is different with TFT display used by author,
i change the original TFT library to MCUFriend KBV library, and working.

The original design is here, use Google translate to understand:
http://srukami.inf.ua/pultoscop_v2.html

When i tried the design same as what like Author did, the Pultoscope LCD TFT version is not working as i expected,
The problem was because i used different ID of 2.4" Arduino LCD Shield not same as used by author, 
So i debugging it, porting to MCUfriend kbv library.

Successful video about this design, you can find at my youtube channel: "Ngoprek di rumah YT"
