# Modified-PultoScope-by-Srukami
This is my successful version for PultoScope designed by Srukami. Since the TFT display is different with TFT display used by author, i change the TFT library to MCUFriend KBV library

The original design is here, use Google translate to understand:
http://srukami.inf.ua/pultoscop_v2.html

When i tried the design same as what like Author did, the Pultoscope LCD TFT version is not working as i expected,
The problem was because i used different ID of 2.4" Arduino LCD Shield used by author, 
So i debugging it, porting to MCUfriend kbv library.
